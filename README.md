# Data-Structures-and-Algo

🚀 Welcome to my DSA Practice and LeetCode Solutions repository! 🚀

This repository is dedicated to my daily coding practice, focusing on solving LeetCode problems and various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions. All solutions are organized within the single `Questions` folder.

📑 **How It Works:**
- Each solution comes with a comment providing a direct link to the corresponding LeetCode question.
- The `Questions` folder contains categorized sub-folders for easy navigation.

🔍 **Why This Repo?**
- **Daily Commitment:** I commit to solving at least one problem every day for consistent improvement.
- **Learning Together:** Join me on this journey of learning and growth! Feel free to fork, suggest improvements, or share your own solutions.

📌 **Disclaimer:**
Please note that the solutions provided are my interpretations and may vary. DSA is all about diverse approaches, so there might be alternative solutions worth exploring.

Happy coding! 🚀
